But looking at out-state and private provides a better look, for example, for students arriving to the US from abroad, who seek to decide which state to move to for undergraduate studies.\n\nObviously, the latter case is incomplete. Many other factors going into such a decision. The easiest example is for a student who plans to work in a part-time job during his studies. Where would they earn more? That would depend on taxes, minimum wage, rent, etc. Purchasing power and cost of living differs not only between states, but also between cities (e.g., Buffalo vs. NYC are very different cases). But let's assume, for this case, that this tool could be useful not for a final decision making, but to provide some information on expected tutition costs.\n\nHowever, we can also consider these a bit better if we visualize with the **cost of attendance** instead of **tuition** variable.
